# Employee-evaluation-system

In this Project I am trying to solve the problem of Companies as their employees are working from home it is difficult to evaluate there performance. I use python(Tkinter) and openCV to develop a GUI based application to track their movements.

It captures a Screenshot of the window screen and user face via webcam to verify the working status.
